# Vue App with Library

This is an example of a Vue app where components can be exported as a package to be included in other projects.

It is a new project created using `npm init vue@latest` and then tweaked to export the HelloWorld.vue component following the steps in the [Vite Library Mode](https://vite.dev/guide/build#library-mode) docs.
